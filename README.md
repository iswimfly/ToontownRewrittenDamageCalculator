# ToontownRewrittenDamageCalculator
A small program that can accurately calculate the damage of a TTR fight. 

- Requires [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to work.
- If Windows detects this as a "virus" (Windows Protected Your PC) it's because I don't have a certificate or whatever to make that go away. The code's public and you can always build your own version with Visual Studio.

This calculator (currently) covers any fight mechanic outside of The Boiler boss fight, excluding SOS Cards, Pink Slips, and Remotes. 
I do not plan on covering the Boiler or any other "Special" bosses being added to TTR. 
If anything I'll branch off from this or fork it into its own tool because that fight adds a whole additional layer of complexity that isn't needed outside of that fight right now.

Current Features:
- Level 1 - 20 Cogs
- Version 2.0 Cog Support
- Organic and Non-maxed Gag Support

Plans to add:
- Attack SOS Cards
- Remotes
- Pink Slips

PLEASE DM me on Discord @iswimfly if you find any bugs, crashes or have any other feedback.
